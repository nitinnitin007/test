The Account Owner for our customer {!Account.Name} has changed in Salesforce.

The new Account Owner is {!Account.OwnerFullName}.

You can see the Salesforce Account record here:
https://na3.salesforce.com/{!Account.Id}

Please make sure that the Netsuite Customer record is updated to reflect this change.

Thank you.
