The assigned Intapp Project Manager will introduce him/herself to your designated project manager, and send over some documentation to be completed prior to starting work.  This documentation provides the Intapp Professional Services team with vital information that allows us to get the project off to a quick start.

We look forward to working with your team and helping you realize the value of your investment in Intappâ€™s products and services.
