    <subject>Timecard Created for Project without a Project Manager</subject>
    <textOnly>A Timecard was created for a Project that does not have a Project Manager defined.  This has caused the Approver field on the Timecard to be blank.  This must be corrected in order for the resource to submit the timecard for Approval.

The following steps must be performed:

1. Open the Timecard Detail Link: {!pse__Timecard_Header__c.Link}
2. Click the Admin Edit Button and set the Timecard Approver Field equal to the Project Manager
3. If the Timecard Status is Submitted, Click the Admin Edit Button and change the Status of the Timecard to Rejected
4. Navigate to the Project that the Timecard is attached to and set the Project Manager Field

Have a great day!</textOnly>
