Norton Rose Group Selects IntApp

We’re pleased to announce that Norton Rose Group, a leading international legal practice with offices across Europe, the Middle East and Asia, will be implementing IntApp’s Wall Builder and Time Builder solutions. A large firm with over 1000 lawyers, Norton Rose must enforce rigorous confidentiality policy enforcement, acknowledgment and tracking to comply with several UK regulations. In describing the benefits of Time Builder, Brendan McDonagh, Head of Head of Systems and Revenue noted that: “The ability of Time Builder automatically to capture a detailed record of billable activity will compliment our existing time recording systems and practices and will be a significant time-saver for our fee-earners.” For more information, see our News Release at http://www.intapp.com/company/news20080415.html.


2008 Risk Roundtables

IntApp sponsored two Risk Roundtable events in New York in March, with one event for law firms and another for law department representatives. Discussion focused on law firm confidentiality issues. A second series of Roundtable events is taking place this spring. These will focus on risk management issues associated with firm growth (including mergers, lateral hiring, organic expansion). Events will take place in May and June in cities including Dallas, Atlanta, Cleveland, Miami, Washington D.C. and San Francisco. Attendance is by invitation only, so if you or a colleague would like to attend, please email: info@riskroundtable.com. More information can be found at http://www.riskroundtable.com.
