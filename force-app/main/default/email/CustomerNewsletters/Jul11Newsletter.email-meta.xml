IntApp Shortlisted for ILTA Innovative Vendor Award

We are pleased to announce that IntApp has been selected as one of four finalists for the ILTA 2011 Innovative Vendor Awards. For more information, visit www.iltanet.org.

Several IntApp clients have been shortlisted for awards tied to their use of IntApp products as well. Patricia Fitzpatrick, Director of Practice Management at Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP, has been shortlisted for the Risk and Records Management Award for spearheading an ongoing, five-year loss prevention initiative designed to improve firm information risk management practices. As part of this effort, she oversaw the development of enhanced email records management capabilities and the implementation of IntApp Wall Builder to manage confidentiality and ethical screens across the firm&apos;s systems.

Perry Lawrence, Senior Data Integration Architect at O&apos;Melveny &amp; Myers LLP, has been shortlisted for the Emerging Technologies Award for overseeing the firm&apos;s foray into Cloud-based software by successfully integrating a hosted HRIS with the firm&apos;s IT architecture using Integration Builder. The project came in at one-fourth the projected cost and provided valuable experience for future Cloud software adoption.



Connect With Peers at IntApp&apos;s Seventh Annual Wine Tasting Event

Our Seventh Annual ILTA Wine Tasting is also in the works, watch for your invitations in the mail. If you&apos;re a client that has registered to attend ILTA but (understandably) opted out of having your name distributed to vendors, we want to make sure we don&apos;t forget to invite you, so please email Lea.Simon@intapp.com.



Not @ILTA Webinar Series

Not going to ILTA this year? There&apos;s no need to miss out on the experience. We have been running the Not @ILTA Webinar Series for the past two years with great success, and we are excited to offer this webinar series again this year. Topics will cover cloud integrations, CRM integrations, a Time Builder overview and a review of Wall Builder modules for existing customers. Keep an eye on your inbox for more details or email Lea.Simon@intapp.com to make sure you&apos;re invited.



Integration Builder CIDs

The IntApp Collaborative Integration Development (CID) program is IntApp&apos;s most extensive Integration Builder implementation program. It is a solution-oriented training program in which an industry veteran and IntApp expert will work on-site to train individuals and begin work on developing Integration Builder solutions.

If you are an Integration Builder customer who is looking do more with the software, we strongly recommend a CID to get you started in the right direction. If you are interested, please contact your account manager.
