Announcing Abnormal Document Activity Monitoring (ADAM) 

Would your firm want to know if an attorney was planning a lateral move or a staff member was accessing an unusually high volume of client information? With our Abnormal Document Activity Monitoring (ADAM) solution, organizations can quickly identify and address irregularities that may point to bigger problems. 

ADAM provides a straightforward way for firms to passively track DMS activity and monitor trends. By setting configurable alert thresholds, management can receive notifications and respond quickly when user behavior strays outside of the ordinary. 

We held a webinar for this product in June, and since interest was so high, we will be holding a second webinar on August 1st. You can register at http://www.intapp.com/reg/webinarregister.html.



Recent IntApp Events

IntApp CEO John Hall recently chaired the Ark Law Firm Risk Management conference on July 10. In June, IntApp revenue practice group leader Paul Zengilowski chaired the Ark Law Firm Profitability Master Class. 
In July, IntApp representatives were also on hand as panelists at West Legalworks’ Law Firm Expansion Summits in Atlanta and Chicago. 



ILTA 2008

We’re eagerly anticipating connecting with clients, partners and prospective customers at ILTA 2008. For the fourth consecutive year, IntApp has been selected to present as part of ILTA’s state-of-the-art technology showcase. Once again, we’ll also be presenting product and client showcase videos on the in-room TV channels. And we’ll be making several exciting announcements, so stay tuned and come visit us… 
Our Third Annual ILTA Wine Tasting is also in the works, watch for your invitations in the mail. If you’re a client that has registered to attend ILTA but (understandably) opted out of having your name distributed to vendors, we want to make sure we don&apos;t forget to invite you, so please email Lea.Simon@IntApp.com. 



Getting the Most out of Integration Builder

Many firms have a long list of projects they’d like to tackle with their IntApp appliance. Unfortunately, the critical staff members they rely on to design and create integrations are often over-burdened and need help jumpstarting development. Fortunately, that help is available. Look to IntApp and our certified partners for assistance building integration solutions. Whether you are tight on technical resources or want to leverage the experience and skill of an expert consultant with legal application and business process familiarity, IntApp has a program to get your integration development off the ground. 
In June, IntApp announced Collaborative Integration Development (CID) and Integration Boot Camp (IBC). These programs offer &quot;deep dive&quot; training focused on your priority projects. Both are tailored to help you design, scope, and begin implementing your integration projects. If you were unable to attend our June customer webinar and would like more information about CID or IBC, please contact your account manager.
