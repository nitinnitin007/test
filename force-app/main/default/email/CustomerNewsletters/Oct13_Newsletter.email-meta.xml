Intapp Has a New Look

We were excited to unveil our new logo at ILTA this year. If you haven&apos;t had a chance yet, visit www.intapp.com to see our brand new look.



Intapp Acquires APS

In June, Intapp acquired Advanced Productivity Software, the makers of DTE Axiom. The move creates the most sophisticated time management software offering for law firms, uniting the industry&apos;s best time capture, time entry and mobile time recording software applications. As part of efforts leading up to the acquisition, product teams from Intapp and APS worked to integrate the two product lines, so that lawyer activity data automatically captured by Intapp Time Builder can now be seamlessly displayed and acted on directly through DTE Axiom.

Read more information about the acquisition at www.intapp.com.



DTE Axiom Upgrades

Intapp&apos;s expanded development team wasted no time advancing DTE Axiom, releasing four upgrades in the four months since the acquisition.

Most notably, DTE Axiom&apos;s AutoCapture functionality has been replaced with Intapp Time Builder and the two products have been brought together in a unified interface. Other updates include:

-A redesign for the iOS app

-A new Android platform

Integration with eBillingHub to facilitate validation of compliance with e-billing guidelines at the point of time entry

-To learn more or arrange for a demo, please contact your account manager or Tim Prinsen at: Tim.Prinsen@intapp.com.



Introducing Intapp Open 2.0

We are very excited to announce the much anticipated release of Intapp Open 2.0.

Intapp Open 2.0 introduces a Conflicts application to the industryâ€™s leading business acceptance offering. Providing an innovative approach to conflicts search, analysis, resolution, reporting and data management, Intapp Open Conflicts offers the most advanced and comprehensive conflicts of interest solution in the market.

Additionally, Intapp Open 2.0 adds a mobile web application for its Intake solution.

&quot;We evaluated several software options for enhancing intake and conflicts management and quickly determined that the innovative approach offered by Intapp Open, with its modern architecture, quick configurability and polished user interface, would best position our firm to address our long term objectives.&quot;

 -Kimberly Giertz, IT Director, Marshall Gerstein &amp; Borun LLP

To learn more or arrange for a demo, please contact your account manager or Lori Etheridge at: Lori.Etheridge@intapp.com.



Introducing Wall Builder 5.7

We are excited to announce the release of Wall Builder 5.7, which expands the scope of Activity Tracker and includes new security extensions.

With this release, Activity Tracker can be linked to Wall Builder policies, allowing administrators to monitor activity pertaining to a wall. This opens the door to monitoring Wall Builder policies for violations without enforcing security. Activity Tracker has also been expanded to support dynamic groups and matter teams.

New security extensions have been made available for Elite 3E and SharePoint 2013 COM.

To learn more or arrange for a demo, please contact your account manager or Lori Etheridge at: Lori.Etheridge@intapp.com.



HIPAA Survey Report

Intapp recently distributed the &quot;HIPAA Law Firm Risk Survey,&quot; which presents data gathered from 70 law firms across the US. Topics include: People and Strategies, Identifying Personal Health Information, Satisfying the &quot;Minimum Necessary&quot; Standard, and Reputation and Insurance.

&quot;We sponsored this survey to provide our customers and partners with insight into how the legal industry is responding to the new HIPAA Omnibus Rule, which affects a significant number of organizations. We&apos;re working closely with many firms to help them respond, supporting their efforts to safeguard and monitor the treatment of sensitive information and meet their compliance objectives.&quot;

 -Pat Archbold, head of Intapp&apos;s Risk Practice

&quot;Like most law firms, we are experiencing an unprecedented number of information security audits from our clients. Traditionally, clients accepted firm assurances about information governance practices, but today more and more clients require explicit proof that firms have technical controls in place to properly restrict internal access to their sensitive business information. Intapp Wall Builder gives our firm a competitive edge when responding to client RFPs and enables us to confidently face client audits. The product also enables us to address the compliance requirements mandated by the new HIPAA Omnibus Rule.&quot;

 -John Guyer, Director of Information Technology, Hinckley, Allen &amp; Snyder LLP

If you would like to receive a copy of the report, please email Jason.Yu@intapp.com.



ILTA Recap

We enjoyed interacting with our current customers and partners and building relationships with those firms we hope to serve in the future at ILTA this year.

Our ninth annual ILTA wine tasting reception was a huge success. Over 150 people attended, and we enjoyed connecting with our customers over a glass (or two) of wine.
