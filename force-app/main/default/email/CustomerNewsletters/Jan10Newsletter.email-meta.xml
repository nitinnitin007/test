Activity Tracker 2.0

We&apos;re pleased to announce the availability of Activity Tracker 2.0. (Formerly known as ADAM.)

Activity Tracker watches for unusual activity and gives management an early warning so they can investigate and address any concerns before they become serious crises.

With the help of Activity Tracker, several IntApp clients have:

-Successfully prevented lateral defections

-Blocked inappropriate treatment or leakage of firm and client information

-Improved internal utilization of firm applications and user productivity

You can learn more about Activity Tracker by accessing our client self-service resource center at http://www.intapp.com/products/atclientconfirm.html. It&apos;s a convenient way to watch a recorded demonstration, hear several client testimonials, and get an overview of the business drivers and benefits of the product. (There&apos;s also a downloadable PDF that summarizes the product&apos;s business benefits, which you might want to circulate internally as well.)



2010 Risk Survey

Last year we sponsored a risk management survey and received an excellent response. Participants included a variety of risk stakeholders including general counsel, loss prevention, risk management and conflicts personnel from over 100 firms.

The 2010 risk management survey is now underway. This year we are conducting a UK risk management survey as well. All participants will receive a copy of the published report. If you have not received an email invitation and would like to take part in the survey, please send an email to Lea.Simon@intapp.com.
