Not @ILTA Webinar Series

Not going to ILTA this year? There&apos;s no need to miss out on the experience. Last year we ran a series of webinars for those of you who couldn&apos;t make it to Conference. We had a great turnout and received a lot of positive feedback, so we&apos;re running the Not @ILTA Webinar Series again this year. Topics include user provisioning, master data management, Elite 3E and Microsoft SharePoint. Keep an eye on your inbox for more details or email Lea.Simon@intapp.com to make sure you&apos;re invited.



Summer Webinars and Conferences

We hosted two very successful webinars recently, featuring IntApp clients Baker Donelson and Morrison &amp; Foerster. These attracted over 200 registrants.

To view recordings of these webinars, visit www.intapp.com/products/ibwebinars.html.

Thank you to all of our guest speakers who have participated in our webinar series.

We would also like to take a moment to recognize several clients for their participation in recent Elite and ADERANT User Conferences. Representatives from Baker &amp; Hostetler, DLA Piper, Davies Ward, Clarke Willmott, Waller Lansden and Withers spoke about their firms&apos; experience with IntApp Time Builder.



Client Product Survey

We recently ran surveys to collect client feedback about our products and services. We would like to thank our clients who participated in the surveys, we received over 100 responses. By providing us with your feedback, you are helping shape the future of our products and improve our services.

As part of the survey, we raffled off two iPod Touches to participants. Congratulations to the winners, Bob Tutt at Armstrong Teasdale and John Bayley at Stites &amp; Harbison.
