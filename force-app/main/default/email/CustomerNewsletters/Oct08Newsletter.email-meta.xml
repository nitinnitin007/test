Additionally, a new category of rule templates for working with Microsoft Office SharePoint 2007 has been published on the IntApp Resource Center at https://www.intapp.com/resourceCenter. These templates enable users to automate common SharePoint tasks such as managing lists and creating sites. Take a look and see how your firm can join the host of IntApp clients already using IntApp to help with SharePoint portal management.



Time Builder 2.5

Time Builder 2.5 was released with several new enhancements including UI improvements and extended desktop and blackberry capture. We recently sponsored and attended the Redwood Analytics User Conference and Paul Zengilowski, head of IntApp&apos;s Revenue Practice Group, led a CFO roundtable on time capture. The session explored timekeeping styles and practices, with the goal of identifying sustainable approaches, policies, incentives and tools to help attorneys capture more billable hours and enter those hour more reliably.



IntApp at ILTA 2008 

IntApp had a very strong presence at ILTA this year. We had 20 team members attend and we sponsored both TV channels. We would like to extend a big thank you to the following firms for participating in new videos this year:

Becker &amp; Poliakoff P.A. 
Berwin Leighton Paisner LLP 
Lawrence Graham LLP 
Loeb &amp; Loeb LLP 
Reed Smith LLP 
Stikeman Elliott LLP 

We connected with many firms at ILTA, and saw several familiar faces and plenty of new ones. The highlight of the week was our annual wine tasting event, where we hosted over 225 guests. Thank you to everyone who attended!



Risk Survey 

Last year we sponsored a risk management survey and received an excellent response. Participants included a variety of risk stakeholders including general counsel, loss prevention, risk management and conflicts personnel at 80 AmLaw 200 firms.

This year we are sponsoring another risk management survey, and we are extending participation to IT audiences, as technology factors heavily into firm risk management issues. If you would like a copy of of our report from last year or would like to learn more about the 2008 program, please email info@riskroundtable.com
