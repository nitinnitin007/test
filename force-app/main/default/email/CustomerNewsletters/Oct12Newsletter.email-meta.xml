Integration Builder Live Template Update

In the last Integration Builder update, we moved our Template Library to the client to give users easier access to our pre-built solutions. This time, we&apos;ve added ten additional templates, including integrations with Elite 3E, DTE Axiom, Wall Builder, Time Builder and more. As our team continues to work with customers, we will develop more templates aimed at addressing those key integration challenges.

To learn more or arrange for a demo, please contact your account manager or Lisa Hern at: Lisa.Hern@intapp.com.

Introducing Wall Builder 5.5

We are proud to announce the release of Wall Builder 5.5. New features include an option for self-maintaining walls to use a date range instead of a look-back value. As a result, clients will have more flexibility in using the self-maintaining feature to populate policies and to keep users updated. There is also a new integration between Wall Builder and Activity Tracker, where administrators will be able to view Activity Tracker alerts for clients and matters on a wall from within Wall Builder.

To learn more or arrange for a demo, please contact your account manager or Lisa Hern at: Lisa.Hern@intapp.com.

Introducing Time Builder 5.2

We are excited to announce the release of Time Builder 5.2. In this release, we focused on two major themes: improving billing accuracy and improving our calendar overview. The billing process is now enhanced to allow viewing of client guidelines with real-time validations of billing entries. To reduce chances of bill rejects, we’ve also added warnings on block billing, as well as granular control over both the firm’s blacklisted words and Outside Counsel Guideline blacklists.

The new “My” Time Overview adds another level of depth to Time Builder’s time management system. Time in any given day is split into entered time and drafted time, which is then broken down into Billable, Non-billable, and Pro Bono categories. We’ve also added target checkpoints by day or month to help attorneys plan their time more efficiently.

To learn more or arrange for a demo, please contact your account manager or Lisa Hern at: Lisa.Hern@intapp.com.

IntApp at ILTA

ILTA provided a great forum for us to learn more about how best to serve the legal community. We enjoyed interacting with our current customers and partners and building relationships with those firms we hope to serve in the future.

Our eighth annual ILTA wine tasting reception was a huge success. Over 200 people attended, and we enjoyed connecting with our customers over a glass (or two) of wine.

We&apos;ve posted a slide show from the event. Hope to see you all again next year!
