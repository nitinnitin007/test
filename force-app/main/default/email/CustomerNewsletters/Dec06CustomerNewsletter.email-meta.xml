IntApp Series 4 – 2006 Customer Loyalty Program Complete


 The 2006 Customer Loyalty Program (concluding today) was a tremendous success. We’re excited to see so many organizations embracing the Series 4 technology:

Series 4 offers significant new functionality, improved risk management capabilities and several enhancements implemented specifically based on direct customer input. In November, we hosted two well-attended webinar demonstrations. Series 4 is set to ship this month, and the IntApp team looks forward to continuing to innovate for our law firm customers.
 

Time’s Not Wasting -- Integrated Time Management (ITM) Update

 
	This year we introduced ITM, a solution that monitors key applications and provides attorneys with an accurate activity journal they can use to more easily track and enter time. Pilot customers told us that this new approach is increasing attorney responsiveness and accelerating the billing process – all without requiring timekeepers to change their behavior or replace their time tracking tools. The net results are shortened billing cycles, eased pre-bill review and increased attorney satisfaction, firm efficiency and revenue.

We recently hosted a webinar on law firm time management practices that included an industry survey report by Parker Houser Consulting, and customer case study presentations by Steve Blackwell, COO of Holme Roberts &amp; Owen and John Guyer, IT Director of Hinckley, Allen &amp; Snyder. Recordings of these presentations are available at www.intapp.com.
