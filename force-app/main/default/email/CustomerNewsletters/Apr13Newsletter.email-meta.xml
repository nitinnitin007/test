Introducing...

We’re proud to announce the general availability of IntApp Open, a fresh approach to new business intake for law firms. The result of a multi-year R&amp;D investment, IntApp Open outshines conventional BPM and workflow toolkits because it’s built specifically for intake, and specifically designed to address the diverse needs of law firm management, lawyer, risk and IT stakeholders. Firms adopting and endorsing the platform include Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP, Eversheds LLP and Lewis Silkin LLP.

Today, multiple market trends are putting new pressures on law firms to transform the way they evaluate and engage new business. If your firm is looking to streamline intake, please contact us to learn more about how we can support your success.
