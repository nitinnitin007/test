ILTA 2009

IntApp had a very strong presence at ILTA this year. We had 13 team members attend and we sponsored both TV channels. We would like to extend a big thank you to the following firms for participating in videos this year:

Davis Wright Tremaine LLP
Faegre &amp; Benson LLP

We have a spare conference t-shirt. If you would like it, email Lea Simon at Lea.Simon@intapp.com. The first person to respond will get it.

We connected with many firms at ILTA, and saw several familiar faces and plenty of new ones. The highlight of the week was our annual wine tasting event, where we hosted about 100 guests. A slideshow of the event is available at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9fFC6Xk0Gw.



&quot;Not @ ILTA&quot; Webinar Series Recap

Because many law firms had a reduced presence at ILTA this year, we held a &quot;Not @ ILTA&quot; webinar series for IT professionals who were not attending Conference. Topics covered were: Business Process Management &amp; Workflows, Attorney Provisioning, Distribution List Management and an introduction to Wall Builder 4.0.

A recording of the Business Process Management &amp; Workflows session is now available on our website at http://www.intapp.com/products/ibwebinars.html.

We also held an iPod Shuffle raffle for webinar attendees. Congratulations to the raffle winner, Paul Miller at Dorsey &amp; Whitney!
