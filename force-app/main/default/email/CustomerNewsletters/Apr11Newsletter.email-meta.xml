Announcing Wall Builder 4.6

We are excited to introduce Wall Builder 4.6. This release includes a configurable homepage that allows users to create custom reports to display in a personalized portal.

Announcing Integration Builder 4.6

We are pleased to announce the availability of Integration Builder 4.6. This release features support for Progress RDBMS, which will make a significant impact for our UK clients. This version also includes various process and usability improvements and new administrative controls.

For more information about this release, visit the Customer Community.



Announcing Time Builder 4.5

We are excited to announce this very significant Time Builder upgrade. With this release, Time Builder delivers additional functionality that has been requested by lawyers as they generate more and more of their time entries from Time Builder. New capabilities include a calendar view with color bar coding that gives lawyers an instant view as to the difference in hours between the time entries they have made in the time entry system and the time captured by Time Builder. The calendar view helps lawyers focus attention on the days where the best opportunities exist to find additional time.

Other enhancements help attorneys more efficiently convert captured activities to time entries by providing narrative codes, spell checking and templates. It is now much more efficient to submit an activity from Time Builder than to rekey into the time entry system.



IntApp Strengthens Partnerships

IntApp works closely with our partners to develop pre-built integration templates that help firms quickly and easily connect applications. The Rule Library contains hundreds of integration templates for working with common legal systems, and has recently expanded to include extended support for NetDocuments, Recommind Decisiv and Chrome River.

The IntApp Resource Center is a valuable resource for our clients who want to get access to documentation and integration templates. If you do not have an account on the Resource Center but you would like one, please contact support@intapp.com.

IntApp Client Success Recognized

Kirkland &amp; Ellis was recently named the winner of Law Technology News&apos; &quot;Most Innovative Use of Technology&quot; award for their use of Wall Builder. Ann Ostrander, Senior Director, Firmwide Loss Prevention, Kirkland &amp; Ellis accepted the award. The Law Technology News Awards recognize the achievements of both vendors and law firms, highlighting legal professionals and organizations who have demonstrated innovative and efficient use of technology.

Kirkland &amp; Ellis deployed IntApp Wall Builder in June, 2010, selecting the product after an extensive evaluation of several available options. The firm chose Wall Builder because of the product&apos;s broad adoption by the legal industry, maturity and ease-of-use, and ability to integrate with and secure key firm applications including its Autonomy iManage document management, Open Text LegalKEY records management, and Carpe Diem time entry software.
