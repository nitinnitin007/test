  Announcing IntApp 3.2  

 IntApp announced availability of its latest product release, version 3.2 last month. This is our most significant release to date and includes several new enhancements in response to direct customer feedback, including:



  
Web Services support that will enable firms that are pursuing the goal of integrating web services into their IT environments to use IntApp to interact with service-oriented applications and connect them with legacy systems.  

  
File management capabilities that expand the appliance’s broad range of supported data repositories to include Windows, Unix and Linux file servers or user workstations.  

  
Improved reporting tools that now include email attachment functionality to automatically collect and format data extracted from multiple repositories and deliver it to recipients&apos; email inboxes.  




  About a quarter of our customers have been upgraded to the new version so far. The entire upgrade process takes less than an hour to complete and no real-time events are disrupted or lost during the process. Many of our customers who have been upgraded have found the new features to be extremely useful. If you have any questions about the upgrade process, or if you have not been contacted by our support team to schedule your own upgrade, please feel free to contact support@intapp.com.


 

  IntApp 3.2 training videos online 
In parallel to the 3.2 upgrade process, we have created training videos that contain tutorials on how to quickly use and deploy 3.2 features in your integration projects. To access these videos, please visit the IntApp Resource Center website. If you have any questions about the tutorials or want to further discuss about these new features, please contact support@intapp.com.
