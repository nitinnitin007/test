We&apos;re eagerly anticipating connecting with clients, partners and prospective customers at ILTA 2009. For the fifth consecutive year, IntApp has been selected to present as part of ILTA&apos;s state-of-the-art technology showcase. Our staff will also be presenting at two panels this year: 

&quot;Can Risk Management Help Grow a Firm&apos;s Profitability, Even in Extreme Financial Conditions?&quot; - Pat Archbold, VP Risk Management Practice - 8/27/2009 10:30 am

If you&apos;re a client that has registered to attend ILTA but (understandably) opted out of having your name distributed to vendors, we want to make sure we don&apos;t forget to invite you, so please email Lea.Simon@intapp.com.

IntApp Webinars

We ran a webinar featuring Matt Carr, IT Director at Woodcock Washburn, and Chris Kave, Principal of Aurora North Software this quarter. The webinar focused on using IntApp&apos;s Integration Builder in conjunction with Microsoft SharePoint and a standardized master data architecture to streamline workflow processes. If you missed the webinar, you can view the presentation on our website at http://www.intapp.com/products/ibwebinars.html. 

We also ran a webinar about recent ABA changes to Model Rule 1.10. The webinar featured a panel of industry experts including Lucian Pera, President of Association of Professional Responsibility Lawyers (APRL); Partner at Adams and Reese LLP, Deborah Jeffrey, Partner, Professional Services Practice Group at Zuckerman Spaeder LLP, AnneMarie Davine, Managing Director at Marsh and Pat Archbold, VP of Risk Management Practice at IntApp. Given the interest in the topic, we will be holding a repeat session in conjunction with Thomson West on August 13th. If you missed the first event or would like to refer a colleague, the registration page can be found at http://tinyurl.com/WestWebinar.
 
We would also like to thank Deborah Jeffrey for her contribution of a brief commentary of the issues raised in the Risk Roundtable webinar. Her commentary can be found on our website at http://www.intapp.com/company/news20090724.html.
