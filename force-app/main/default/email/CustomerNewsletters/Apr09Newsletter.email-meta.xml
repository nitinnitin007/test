IntApp Going Virtual

Last year at ILTA, we announced the virtualization of our entire product line. Many firms have already migrated from hardware to pure-software, or are in the process of doing so. &quot;The process of getting virtualized with IntApp was extremely easy,&quot; said Adam Klein at Loeb &amp; Loeb.

There are several advantages to going virtual -- including improved performance and reduced infrastructure costs -- and IntApp stands ready to help. If you would like more information, please contact Neal Vora at Neal.Vora@intapp.com.

Virtualizing Firms: 
Best Best &amp; Krieger LLP
Cozen O&apos;Connor
Cummings &amp; Lockwood LLC
Fennemore Craig P.C.
Garvey, Schubert &amp; Barer
K&amp;L Gates LLP
Lane Powell PC
Marshall, Gerstein &amp; Borun LLP
Sheppard Mullin Richter &amp; Hampton LLP



IntApp Webinars

We ran a webinar about the benefits of running a Master Data Directory (MDD) this quarter. The MDD serves as a data hub that eliminates the complexity of data management. It ensures that data across applications is consistent and standardized. Mark Raabe, Director of Application Services at Faegre &amp; Benson LLP, and his team talked about his firm&apos;s experience building an MDD. If you missed the webinar, you can view Mark&apos;s presentation on our website at http://www.intapp.com/products/ibwebinars.html. We have also established several threads on the IntApp customer community where firms are sharing their own best practices for building and extending a Master Data Directory. The threads can be viewed at https://www.intapp.com/community/index.php?name=PNphpBB2&amp;file=viewforum&amp;f=27.

We also ran a webinar about the benefits running IntApp software in a virtual environment. The webinar featured a case study presentation by Ramin Pakravan, Manager of Information Technology Systems Design, Engineering, and Development at Manatt, Phelps &amp; Phillips, LLP, who spoke about his firm&apos;s decision to virtualize and the process of virtualizing IntApp. If you missed the webinar, you can view Mr. Pakravan&apos;s presentation on our website at http://www.intapp.com/products/ibwebinars.html.

Time Builder Adoption Program

Given the current economic environment, interest remains high in IntApp Time Builder. For current Time Builder clients, we have developed new training and adoption resources to make sure they get the most out of their investment. These resources will help firms implement a successful roll out of the software and maximize adoption. Materials include an implementation overview, internal marketing, a training syllabus, a Time Builder Handbook and feedback forms. Additionally, if your firm is an approved MCLE provider, your Time Builder training classes could qualify for CLE credit. Best Best &amp; Krieger LLP has already acquired CLE credit for their Time Builder training course. We would like to thank their trainer, Dalene Leach, for sharing the process they followed to qualify for CLE credit and encouraging us to incorporate it into our adoption program materials..

If you are a current Time Builder customer who would like to receive a copy of the adoption materials or if you are interested in learning more about Time Builder contact your account manager.
