Introducing Integration Builder 4.8

We are happy to announce the release of Integration Builder 4.8. With this release, we&apos;ve added the Template Library, which integrates IntApp&apos;s collection of rule templates previously maintained on the Resource Center into the product itself. We’ve added new Alert types, allowing users to monitor loss of connectivity to a Datasource and the integrity of real-time Events, and we’ve also improved the functionality of Integration Builder, allowing users to have an even easier experience with the interface. The update gives users:

An &quot;Edit in Window...&quot; right-click option for SOAP Web Service Input fields

The ability to drag and drop supported objects between Projects or Folders

The ability to upload an SSL certificate to be used in encrypted web and web service communication

Improved editing function parameters via the keyboard by automatically scrolling the parent window when needed

The ability  to dynamically size Action and Node titles in the Rule Editor

The ability to activate and deactivate Alerts


To learn more or arrange for a demo, please contact your account manager or Lisa Hern at: Lisa.Hern@intapp.com.

Introducing Wall Builder 5.3 and Legal Holds module

We are excited to announce two new updates for Wall Builder. The 5.3 update focuses on improving notifications and enhancing efficiency. New features include:

Digest notifications

Ability to preview list of recipients from within notification editor preview pane

&quot;Smart lookup&quot; so only notification recipients&apos; names can be entered and then their email addresses will display

Ability to configure the legal holds module to preserve data in specified downstream systems.

Matter Team Manager: ability to &quot;subscribe&quot; to a matter team

... and much more



Legal Holds module

We have also recently released our Legal Holds module for Wall Builder. If you are currently managing your internal legal holds manually, contact us to see if our module can help automate your needs.

To learn more or arrange for a demo, please contact your account manager or Lisa Hern at: Lisa.Hern@intapp.com.

Introducing Time Builder 5.1

We are proud to announce the release of Time Builder 5.1. With this release, we’ve made time entry even easier and more efficient by adding the ability to clone time entries. The new Heads-Down Time Entry feature increases efficiency even more by giving users the option to open a new activity form the moment the one they are currently working on is saved or submitted. We’ve also added support for Wall Builder and ethical walls, so that Time Builder is automatically integrated with ethical walls security, preventing Time Builder events from occurring that involve disallowed clients or matters.

To learn more or arrange for a demo, please contact your account manager or Lisa Hern at: Lisa.Hern@intapp.com.

Recent Webinars

We hosted several webinars this spring and have many more in the works.

Risk Webinars

Pat Archbold, head of IntApp’s Risk Practice, hosted a Risk Webinar on Information Security Trends, featuring client case studies by McGuireWoods and Loeb &amp; Loeb. The webinar was co-sponsored by ILTA and panelists discussed topics including Client audits, ISO 27001, and “Open” vs “Closed” DMS models.

Integration Webinars

Sohail Merchant, Associate Director of IT at Kilpatrick Townsend, presented an Integration Webinar on their firm’s 2011 merger and how Integration Builder addressed specific challenges and needs of the combined firm. Specific topics included:

Consolidating email domains and managing distribution lists

Managing cross-billed matters across the two firms with financial systems running in parallel


Revenue Webinars

John Sroka, CIO, and Michele Bertoldi, Elite Application Manager at Duane Morris presented a Revenue Webinar, on their firm’s experience implementing IntApp Time Builder. They describe the process of executing two pilot programs to gauge the success of the software and outline their approach to training, which has resulted in high lawyer adoption rates.

Regional User Groups and Risk Roundtables

We have recently hosted user groups in:

New York, hosted by White &amp; Case

London, the UK Integration user group held at the Hilton London Tower Bridge

Washington DC, hosted by Sterne Kessler Goldstein Fox


We also hosted a UK Risk Roundtable seminar in London. The topic was Open vs Closed DM and the new &quot;need to know access model&quot;. The event was over-subscribed, so we are planning to take this seminar on the road in the next few months -- Bristol, Birmingham, Manchester and Jersey -- watch for details. For more information about our Risk Roundtable series, visit riskroundtable.com.

Lastly, we hosted a Finance Forum in New York, co-sponsored by Elite, at Thomson Hall.

Thank you to the many clients who have hosted regional IntApp events.
