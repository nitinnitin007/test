    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I&apos;ve attached the latest update from IntApp. At your request, we&apos;ve updated our process to send you these mailers electronically. (If you&apos;d prefer not to receive future updates from us, just let me know.)

A letter from our VP Marketing [http://j.mp/IntakeLetter]

IntApp has recently released a new software product called IntApp Open. It was designed from the ground up specifically for new business intake and is not a general workflow platform. In developing it, we leveraged input from an advisory group comprising law firms, insurance providers and industry consulting experts. I&apos;ve attached this bulletin [http://j.mp/IntakeSheet] that describes the product in more detail.

I&apos;ve also attached this ILTA article [http://j.mp/IntakeILTA] on new business intake, which talks about the changing state of how law firms should be addressing their intake process in relation to their long-term business goals.

Please feel free to email info@intapp.com or contact me directly if you&apos;d like to see a product demonstration or just to learn more.

Regards,

Jason Yu
