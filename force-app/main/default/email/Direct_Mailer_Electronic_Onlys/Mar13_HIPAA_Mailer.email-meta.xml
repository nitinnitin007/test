A letter from our risk practice [http://j.mp/HIPAAletter]

With the 2013 HIPAA Omnibus Rule coming into effect this month, many law firms are faced with the challenge of maintaining compliance with the new regulations. This bulletin [http://j.mp/HIPAASheet] describes those challenges in detail and shows how IntApp can help firms in addressing those challenges.

Regards,

Jason Yu
