Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

On the evening of April 12 we released RB version 4.0.8. There is an issue with this patch that may affect the performance of scheduled rules on Series 4 appliances to a critical degree.   In certain cases this patch may have prevented your scheduled rules from firing after the installation of RB 4.0.8.  This issue does NOT affect real-time rules in any way.

We have released a fix and it has been applied to your appliance already. If you need any assistance or have additional questions, please do not hesitate to contact our support team.

Thank you,

Integration Appliance Support.
