Hi {!Contact.FirstName}, 

We have recently been alerted that your appliance has stopped sending nightly backups to our servers. In the event of a hardware failure, nightly backups allow us to ship a fully restored replacement appliance to you within 24 hours or to immediately start the process of bringing up a cold-swap appliance. 

Backups currently operate by way of sending an email to a designated Integration Appliance account. The usual cause for a missing backup is that a mail server upstream of the appliance is not allowing relaying. Most users are able to work around this by adding the appliance to an exception list. 

Please, let me know if I can help out in any way.
