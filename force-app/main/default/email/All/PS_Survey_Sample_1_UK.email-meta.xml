    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Following the completion of the Intapp [Product] project, please would you provide us with feedback on the delivery of the project - myself as the project manager, [Name] as the consultant, and [Name] as the engineer.

Our approach to delivery is continuously reviewed and improved and customer feedback is vital to this. We strive for a 10 out of 10 (of course) and where you feel we have fallen short, we would like to know. And also what you feel went well. Where you feel we scored 7 or less, one of our directors will reach out to discuss your feedback further.

Many thanks in advance,
