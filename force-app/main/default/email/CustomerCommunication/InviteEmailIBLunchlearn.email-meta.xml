IntApp Lunch-and-Learn – Integration Builder

Wouldn&apos;t it be nice to streamline new business intake, distribution list management and other key law firm processes? In a perfect world, all legal applications would work well together, and this would be easy. But in the real world, organizations often make do with ad hoc, manual processes or invest in cumbersome custom development – frequently with results that include inefficiency, error and unhappy end users.

Integration Builder from IntApp provides law firms with a simple, straightforward way to connect and manage applications without the cost, complexity and time required by custom development. Enabling organizations to rapidly address common challenges, IntApp provides pre-built solution templates and best practices. In use by over 100 legal organizations, including 35% of the AmLaw 200, IntApp technology has been embraced and endorsed as an industry standard.

Attend this session to learn more and to see it in action.
