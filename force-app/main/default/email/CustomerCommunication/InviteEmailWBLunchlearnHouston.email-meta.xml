IntApp Lunch-and-Learn – Wall Builder

Come join us for an informal lunch and discussion about IntApp Wall Builder and how it helps firms manage risk and confidentiality enforcement.

IntApp Wall Builder enables firms to closely manage access to internal information. Scenarios driving the need for confidentiality include waiver-driven ethical walls, client requirements, management concerns about the scope of access available to contract attorneys and compliance with regulations such as SEC, SOX, HIPAA, ITAR and European Union directives.

Wall Builder provides law firms with centralized control, enforcement and visibility of confidentiality policies. With over 100 customers, including 35% of the AmLaw 200, and a vibrant partner community, IntApp has been embraced and endorsed as an industry standard.

Attend this session to learn more.


Date: Wednesday, June 11
Time: 11:30am – 1:00pm with lunch included


Location:
Vinson &amp; Elkins, L.L.P.
