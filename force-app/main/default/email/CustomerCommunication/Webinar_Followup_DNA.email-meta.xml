    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I&apos;m sorry you were unable to attend the IntApp webinar on the ABA changes to Rule 1.10 last week. We had over 100 attendees and have received very positive feedback. 

A recording of the webinar is now available on our website and can be found at http://www.intapp.com/products/wbwebinars.html.</textOnly>
