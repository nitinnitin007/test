Firm Growth and Risk Management – Mergers, Lateral Hire and Expansion

If your firm is pursuing a growth strategy, it’s facing a number of risks. Some are fundamentally strategic -- is growth the best way to achieve desired gains in capability, efficiency or profitability? Others are operational -- what issues jeopardize successful expansion and how can the organization address them?
No matter the scale of expansion, poor risk management can significantly impact firm performance, attorney productivity, and client satisfaction and retention.
This session will explore practical approaches for identifying and managing operational risks as firms grow. It will include case studies, insider perspectives, and best practices developed by top-ranked firms, including insights collected from risk professionals responsible for six of the largest mergers in 2007.
    * Conflicts: Streamlining conflicts identification, management and clearing during mergers and major lateral hire initiatives
    * Clients: Managing client expectations and service experience amidst changing firm composition
    * Confidentiality: Protecting confidential information as new resources join (or leave) the firm
    * People: Accelerating productivity and avoiding poor impressions when bringing on lateral resources
