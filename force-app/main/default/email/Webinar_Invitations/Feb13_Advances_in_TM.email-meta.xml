    <textOnly>Hi David,

I’d like to invite you to a webinar we’re hosting on recent advances in the Time Builder solution. Over the past two years, IntApp has made a significant investment in developing time management capabilities that combine capture with time entry (and timers) and mobility. This has delivered significant advances in the arena of governance and compliance, including electronic billing conformance, eBillingHub integration, and recognition of ethical walls. And as you likely know, Time Builder has greatly improved upon the traditional time recording functions by infusing tasks with capture data to improve lawyer efficiency and productivity.

Join us for a brief overview and demonstration of Time Builder’s new Time Management capabilities as well as a review of our roadmap for the year.

The webinar will be presented by Eldean Ward, head of IntApp’s Revenue Practice.

Here are the quick details:

Date: Thursday, February 21

Time: 9am Pacific / 12pm Eastern / 5pm GMT

Duration: 1 hour

Registration: http://www.intapp.com/advances-in-time-management-webinar

I’ve attached a copy of the official invitation below. I hope you can make it.

We’ll be recording this session, so if you’re interested, but unable to attend, please let me know and I’ll send you the recording when it’s available.

Regards,

Jason Yu
